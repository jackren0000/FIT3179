### **FIT3179: Crafting Visual Stories with Data! üìä‚ú®**

Welcome to my **FIT3179** repository! This unit was all about the art and science of **data visualization**. It's where I learned to transform raw data into compelling visual stories, making complex information accessible and insightful.

#### **What You'll Find Here üöÄ**

This repository contains various data visualization projects and exercises from the FIT3179 unit:

*   **`.json` files (e.g., `Homework.json`, `linechart.json`, `militarymap.json`):** These are likely Vega-Lite specifications for different types of charts and interactive visualizations.
*   **`.csv` and `.xlsx` files (e.g., `GDP.csv`, `happiness.csv`, `Information.xlsx`):** The datasets used for the visualizations.
*   **`index.html`:** The main HTML file that likely embeds and displays the Vega-Lite visualizations.
*   **`vega_lite_vis.js`:** A JavaScript file that might contain custom logic for rendering or interacting with the Vega-Lite visualizations.
*   **`.geo-3-2.json`, `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.topojson`:** These files suggest map-based visualizations, likely for geographical data.

#### **My Data Visualization Journey ‚ú®**

This unit allowed me to:

*   **Master Data Visualization Principles:** Learn how to design effective and aesthetically pleasing charts.
*   **Utilize Vega-Lite:** Gain hands-on experience with Vega-Lite for creating declarative and interactive visualizations.
*   **Work with Diverse Datasets:** Practice visualizing various types of data, including economic, social, and geographical information.
*   **Tell Stories with Data:** Develop the ability to communicate insights and narratives through visual representations.
*   **Web-Based Visualization:** Understand how to embed and display interactive visualizations on web pages.

#### **Tech I'm Using üõ†Ô∏è**

*   Vega-Lite (for declarative visualization)
*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web integration)
*   Various data formats (CSV, JSON)
