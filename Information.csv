Australia,"Australia's changing security environment will 
          lead to new demands being placed on the Australian
          Defence Force. Although it is not expected that 
          Australia will face any threat of direct attack 
          from another country, terrorist groups and tensions 
          between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian 
          security. 
United States,"The U.S. Armed Forces are considered the world's most powerful military.[12][13] The military budget of the United States was US$693 billion in 2019, the highest in the world.[14] In 2018, that accounted for 36 percent of the world's defense expenditures. The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful technologies which enables a widespread deployment of the force around the world, including around 800 military bases outside the United States.["

South Korea,"After the Korean War, North Korea maintained a powerful, but smaller military force than that of South Korea. In 1967 the KPA forces of about 345,000 were much smaller than the South Korean ground forces of about 585,000.[45] North Korea's relative isolation and economic plight starting from the 1980s has now tipped the balance of military power into the hands of the better-equipped South Korean military."
